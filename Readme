Our digital photo collections are particularly messy, since we take so many photos from so many different devices, 
without ever giving much thought to what images we will keep, where we will store them, and how we will ever retrieve them if we need them.

In this project, I would like to talk about the program I developed in order to separate the digital photos we have according to the date and
location.
